Contributions to this project are welcomed and encouraged, you can use existing GameModifications as reference on how to make your own, but here are a couple requirements:

Your GameModification must be contained inside a folder of the same name, even if your modification is just one file.

You are welcome and encouraged to use multiple CS files to implement your game modification, but if your modification is excessively large or complex it might be rejected, before working on something you suspect will turn out to be large and complex, I encourage you to reach out beforehand.
